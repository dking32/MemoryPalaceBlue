# MemoryPalaceBlue
## Intro (What the Purpose of this Project Is)
The method of loci, or memory palace technique, is a memorization technique whereby a user more easily memorizes a list of words or phrases by 
associating them with objects/furniture in an imaginary room or set of rooms that the user has built up in their own minds. This technique was popularized by the "Sherlock"
TV show and has been shown to be one of the most effective memorization techniques, with the majority of top memorization experts (yes, they are a thing!) 
using the technique in memorization competitions.
<br/><br/> 
As VR and 3D game technology has become more prevalent, digital "method of loci" simulations have been developed. These simulations allow users to implement the memory palace 
technique using a virtual 3D room or set of rooms rather than an imaginary one. Despite initial skepticism about such digital simulations, recent studies have shown that 
they are generally as effective as imaginary memory palaces in aiding memorization of long lists of items.
<br/><br/>
The goal of my project was to contribute to the research surrounding these digital memory palaces. My goal was to test whether different colored objects/furniture in a 3D memory
palace simulation would impact user memorization. Several studies suggest that the color of text impacts how well users are able to memorize the text (cooler colors such as blue
or green are more conducive to memorization than warmer colors such as red), and I wanted to apply that research to this project.
<br/><br/>
I made three separate memory palace simulations: one with blue (cool color) furniture, another with red (warm color) furniture, and another with grey (neutral color) furniture
that served as a control. This repo only contains the simulation with blue furniture, but I might add repos for the red and grey simulations in the future. The simulation is
rather primitive-looking because I had no prior experience with 3D game development, I was in high school, and I made the simulation using jMonkeyEngine, a Java-based 3D game 
engine that I had no prior experience using, but for the purposes of the project, it worked.
## How to Try the Simulation For Yourself
1. Download or clone this repo onto your machine (click the green "Code" button at the top right to download)
2. Unzip the downloaded file, open the "dist" folder, then open MyGame.jar.
3. A settings window will open. You can change them as you want (they're fine the way they are), then click "Continue".
4. A new window with the simulation will open up. This may take several seconds to several minutes depending on your machine.
5. If you've played any keyboard-and-mouse first-person shooter game, the controls should be intuitive. Use WASD to move, space to jump, and the mouse to look around.
6. NOTE: To exit the simulation, simply press the "escape" key on your keyboard.
## How to View the Source Code
1. Open the "src" folder.
2. Open the "mygame" folder.
3. You can view the source code.
4. NOTE: I unfortunately was a beginning programmer when I did this project (I had what I had learned from AP Computer Science A in terms of programming experience and that
was about it) and that's why everything is in one file. It's kind of a miracle that I was able to get the simulation to work, and I'm also grateful for how much better I've gotten
since then.
